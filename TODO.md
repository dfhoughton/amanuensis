# Things I should get around to

- [ ] make it possible to hide portions of the automatically selected text when it is too long (I'm looking at you, German magazines).
- [ ] add internationalization (tough because of the intermixed style)
  - create per-locale functions to return help text?
- [x] make the note tag suggestions smaller
  - this seems to be a bit busted in mui v4; have installed a temporary hack in index.html (see below)
- [ ] convert the React code to a more standard style
- [ ] figure out what is happening when selections aren't registered and you need to reload the page
- [ ] make hot keys configurable
- [ ] make the default citation for a note *the last one seen*, not the first
  - [ ] favorite citation seems to be written for pushing rather than shifting citations
- [ ] make expand elaboration configurable
- [ ] links are sometimes broken
  - [ ] haven't seen this lately; collect more details 
- [ ] perhaps add substring test to similarity measures
- [ ] make expandos scroll with their context
  - they should be doing this already; maybe this is a mui 4 vs 5 thing?
- [ ] convert to mui 5
   - [ ] remove the style hack in index.html
- [x] make text in citation widget non-expando
- [ ] switch to manifest v3
- [ ] consider ways to make the search form more compact and hide more noise
   - advanced search button
   - fix the sorter stuff somehow
   - expand width of extension (don't like this aesthetically)
