# Things I should get around to

- make it possible to hide portions of the automatically selected text when it is too long (I'm looking at you, German magazines).
- add internationalization
- put the pagination widget at the top as well as the bottom of the search results
- convert the React code to a more standard style
- figure out what is happening when selections aren't registered and you need to reload the page
- make hot keys configurable
