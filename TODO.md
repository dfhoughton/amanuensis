# Things I should get around to

- make it possible to hide portions of the automatically selected text when it is too long (I'm looking at you, German magazines).
- add internationalization
- make the note tag suggestions smaller
- convert the React code to a more standard style
- figure out what is happening when selections aren't registered and you need to reload the page
- make hot keys configurable
- make the default citation for a note *the last one seen*, not the first
- favorite citation seems to be written for pushing rather than shifting citations
- make expand elaboration configurable
- links are sometimes broken
- perhaps add substring test to similarity measures
- fix labels with the before and after time search fields -- the should always be displaced
- make expandos scroll with their context
